          <p>
            Philosophy graduate of the Jagiellonian University with over 5 years
            of professional experience in the field of customer service and
            almost 2 years in administration/accounting. My priority in any work
            is improving my qualifications, acquiring new knowledge and building
            positive relations with others. I enjoy creative problem solving and
            finding new ways to optimize my workflow.

            I am ready to start my new career as a frontend developer. I would
            like to join a passionate creative team ready to share their
            knowledge with me as I would love to learn all the best industry
            practices. Through my work as a frontend developer I wish to make
            the internet at least a little bit better, prettier and more
            accessible.
