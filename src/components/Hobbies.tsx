            <h4>Video Games</h4>
            <p>
              I mostly enjoy role-playing games, platformers, roguelikes and
              roguelites, indie classics, card games and any other unorthodox
              productions. I am currently playing Pillars of Eternity II:
              Deadfire as well as Gwent: The Witcher Card Game. According to
              Steam, my other top played games are Path of Exile, RimWorld and
              Warframe.

            <h4>Films</h4>
            <p>
              My favourites are genre films - horrors, science-fiction,
              thrillers, and action films. I also like cult classics and class B
              films (aka "midnight flicks") and class Z films (aka "so bad it's
              good"). I love the 70s and 80s aesthetics and themes, and also the
              classic 30s German Expressionist vibes. My favourite films of the
              year 2022 are Everything Everywhere All at Once, The Northman and
              Watcher.

              <h4>Literature</h4>
              <p>
                I enjoy modernist and postmodernist dramas and short stories. My
                favourite authors include Franz Kafka, Herman Melville, William
                Faulkner, H.P. Lovecraft, Stanisław Lem and Fyodor Dostoevsky. I
                also read non-fiction from the realms of philosophy (Deleuze,
                Nietzsche, Heidegger), psychoanalysis (Lacan, Freud, Jung), and
                others (Kahneman, Harari, Sacks).

              <h4>Music</h4>
              <p>
                I love discovering new bands, new styles and new genres. Even
                though there are bands that I keep coming back to (The Beatles,
                Radiohead, MF DOOM, Talking Heads, Beach House) I am constantly
                on the search for something new. I enjoy making music playlists
                to catalogue my discoveries (see my lusco-fusco app in the
                Projects section or just click here to jump to that section).

              <h4>Other</h4>
              <p>
                Apart from the above I also enjoy working out (calisthenics),
                playing with my cat Dżuma and of course spending time with my
                friends - playing board games, watching films together or just
                cooking, drinking and talking about nonsense. When I feel
                inspired I like to write short stories about completely
                fictional people in completely made-up scenarios.
